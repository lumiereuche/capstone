      <p className='pt-12 px-5' >My name is suga. I first became interested in tech in 2022, when I began exploring online tutorials. However, I quickly realized that I needed more hands-on experience, so I enrolled in a physical class. The class has given me the opportunity to work on a project, which is a blogging website. The website is designed to be both functional and user-friendly, with a variety of features to make the user experience as enjoyable as possible. I am passionate about tech, and I am excited to continue learning and growing in this field.</p>
